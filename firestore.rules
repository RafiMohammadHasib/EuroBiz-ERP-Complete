/**
 * This ruleset enforces a security model for the BizFin Sales ERP application.
 *
 * Core Philosophy:
 * The security model is built around user ownership and roles. It assumes that an authenticated
 * user's UID corresponds directly to a `salespersonId` or a `customerId`.
 * This allows for a strict separation of data: salespeople can only manage their own
 * profiles and commissions, and customers can only manage their own profiles,
 * invoices, and related documents. Business-wide data is readable by all signed-in
 * users but is writable only by users with an 'admin' role.
 *
 * Data Structure:
 * The data is organized into top-level collections for core business entities
 * (`products`, `distribution_channels`) and primary user types (`salespeople`,
 * `customers`). All user-specific data, such as commissions or invoices, is stored
 * in subcollections under the corresponding user's document (e.g.,
 * `/salespeople/{salespersonId}/commissions/...`). A `user_roles` collection
 * maps user UIDs to roles (e.g., 'admin').
 *
 * Key Security Decisions:
 * - User/Owner Mapping: It is assumed that `request.auth.uid` directly maps to the
 *   document ID in the `/salespeople` or `/customers` collections. This is the
 *   foundation of the ownership model.
 * - Admin Role for Writes on Business Data: Top-level collections like `products` and
 *   `distribution_channels` are readable by any authenticated user but are only
 *   writable by users with an 'admin' role, checked via the `isAdmin()` function.
 * - Read-Only Reporting Collections: The commission data duplicated under `/products`
 *   and `/distribution_channels` is treated as a read-only view for reporting.
 *   This prevents data integrity issues that could arise from client-side writes.
 * - Customer Listing: The rules allow listing the top-level `/customers` collection for authenticated users
 *   to enable functionality like creating invoices for any customer.
 *
 * Denormalization for Authorization:
 * The ruleset leverages denormalized fields (e.g., `salespersonId` on a commission
 * document) to enforce path integrity and security without needing expensive `get()`
 * calls to parent documents. On creation, these fields are validated to ensure they
 * match the document's path, creating a secure link. On update, these fields are
 * enforced as immutable.
 *
 * Structural Segregation:
 * User-specific data (commissions, invoices) is segregated into subcollections
 * under the owner's document path. This ensures that all documents within a given
 * collection path share the same ownership and security context, enabling secure
 * and efficient list operations for the owner.
